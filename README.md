# WebdriverIO example
This is an example webdriverio test that runs on TestObject.

To run the test, first install the dependencies with:
`npm install`

You will then need to configure the following environment variables (or overwrite them in wdio.conf.js):
```
TESTOBJECT_API_KEY
TESTOBJECT_APP_ID
TESTOBJECT_DEVICE
TESTOBJECT_APPIUM_VERSION
```

You can then run the tests with:
`npm test`
